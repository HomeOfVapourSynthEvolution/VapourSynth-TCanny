Description
===========

Builds an edge map using canny edge detection.

Ported from AviSynth plugin http://bengal.missouri.edu/~kes25c/


Usage
=====

    tcanny.TCanny(clip clip[, float[] sigma=1.5, float t_h=8.0, float t_l=1.0, int mode=0, int op=1, float gmmax=50.0, int opt=0, int[] planes])

* clip: Clip to process. Any planar format with either integer sample type of 8-16 bit depth or float sample type of 32 bit depth is supported.

* sigma: Standard deviation of gaussian blur. If a single sigma is specified, it will be used for all planes. The value used internally will be adjusted according to the subsampling of the second and third plane in each direction. If two sigma are given then the second value will be used for the third plane as well.

* t_h: High gradient magnitude threshold for hysteresis.

* t_l: Low gradient magnitude threshold for hysteresis.

* mode: Sets output format.
  * -1 = gaussian blur only
  * 0 = thresholded edge map (2^bitdepth-1 for edge, 0 for non-edge)
  * 1 = gradient magnitude map
  * 2 = edge pixel only gradient direction map (non-edge pixels set to 0)
  * 3 = gradient direction map

* op: Sets the operator for edge detection.
  * 0 = the operator used in tritical's original filter
  * 1 = the operator proposed by P. Zhou et al.
  * 2 = the Sobel operator
  * 3 = the Scharr operator

* gmmax: Used for scaling gradient magnitude into [0, 2^bitdepth-1] for mode=1.

* opt: Sets which cpu optimizations to use.
  * 0 = auto detect
  * 1 = use c
  * 2 = use sse2
  * 3 = use avx
  * 4 = use avx2

* planes: A list of the planes to process. By default all planes are processed.


    tcanny.TCannyCL(clip clip[, float[] sigma=1.5, float t_h=8.0, float t_l=1.0, int mode=0, int op=1, float gmmax=50.0, bint info=False, int[] planes])

* info: Whether the OpenCL-related info is drawn on the frame.


Compilation
===========

Requires `Boost` unless `--disable-opencl` is specified.

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```
